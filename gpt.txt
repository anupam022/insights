Context Learning in GPT-Generative Pre-Trained Transformer

GPT Prompt Engineering -->
Prompt Engineering: This involves crafting effective prompts to guide the model 
in generating desired outputs. It's crucial for tailoring the behavior of the model
to specific applications.

--> Involves human writing refining and optimizing prompts in a structured way.
--> Linguistic are key to prompt Engineering.
 
Linguistics is like being a detective for language. It's about studying how we use words, 
sounds, and grammar to communicate. Linguists look at things like how words are formed,
how sentences are structured, and what different sounds mean in different languages.
They also explore how languages change over time and how people from different groups
or places might speak differently. It's a bit like understanding the hidden rules
and patterns behind how we talk and write.

 Vectorization-->
Vectorization refers to the process of converting an algorithm or operation from 
operating on a single element at a time to operating on multiple elements (vectors)
simultaneously. This is particularly relevant in the context of parallel processing
and can significantly improve the efficiency of numerical computations.
